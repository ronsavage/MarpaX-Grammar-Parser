=head1 NAME

C<MarpaX::Grammar::Parser> - Converts a Marpa grammar into a tree using Tree::DAG_Node

=head1 Synopsis

	use MarpaX::Grammar::Parser;

	my(%option) =
	(		# Inputs:
		marpa_bnf_file   => 'share/metag.bnf',
		user_bnf_file    => 'share/stringparser.bnf',
			# Outputs:
		cooked_tree_file => 'share/stringparser.cooked.tree',
		raw_tree_file    => 'share/stringparser.raw.tree',
	);

	MarpaX::Grammar::Parser -> new(%option) -> run;

For more help, run:

	 perl scripts/bnf2tree.pl -h

See share/*.bnf for input files and share/*.tree for output files.

Installation includes copying all files from the share/ directory, into a dir chosen by
L<File::ShareDir>. Run scripts/find.grammars.pl to display the name of that dir.

=head1 Description

C<MarpaX::Grammar::Parser> uses L<Marpa::R2> to convert a user's BNF into a tree of
Marpa-style attributes, (see L</raw_tree()>), and then post-processes that (see L</compress_tree()>)
to create another tree, this time containing just the original grammar (see L</cooked_tree()>).

The nature of these trees is discussed in the L</FAQ>. The trees are managed by L<Tree::DAG_Node>.

Lastly, the major purpose of the cooked tree is to serve as input to L<MarpaX::Grammar::GraphViz2>,
which graphs such cooked trees. That module has its own
L<demo page|http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/marpax.grammar.graphviz2/index.html>.

=head1 Installation

Install C<MarpaX::Grammar::Parser> as you would for any C<Perl> module:

Run:

	cpanm MarpaX::Grammar::Parser

or run:

	sudo cpan MarpaX::Grammar::Parser

or unpack the distro, and then either:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	sudo ./Build install

or:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make (or dmake or nmake)
	make test
	make install

=head1 Constructor and Initialization

C<new()> is called as C<< my($parser) = MarpaX::Grammar::Parser -> new(k1 => v1, k2 => v2, ...) >>.

It returns a new object of type C<MarpaX::Grammar::Parser>.

Key-value pairs accepted in the parameter list (see also the corresponding methods
[e.g. L</marpa_bnf_file([$bnf_file_name])>]):

=over 4

=item o bind_attributes => Boolean

Include (1) or exclude (0) attributes in the tree file(s) output.

Default: 0.

=item o cooked_tree_file => aTextFileName

The name of the text file to write containing the grammar as a cooked tree.

If '', the file is not written.

Default: ''.

Note: The bind_attributes option/method affects the output.

=item o logger => aLog::HandlerObject

By default, an object of type L<Log::Handler> is created which prints to STDOUT.

See C<maxlevel> and C<minlevel> below.

Set C<logger> to '' (the empty string) to stop a logger being created.

Default: undef.

=item o marpa_bnf_file => aMarpaBNFFileName

Specify the name of Marpa's own BNF file. This distro ships it as share/metag.bnf.

This option is mandatory.

Default: ''.

=item o maxlevel => $level

This option is only used if this module creates an object of type L<Log::Handler>.

See L<Log::Handler::Levels>.

Nothing is printed by default.

Default: 'notice'.

=item o minlevel => $level

This option affects L<Log::Handler> objects.

See the L<Log::Handler::Levels> docs.

Default: 'error'.

No lower levels are used.

=item o raw_tree_file => aTextFileName

The name of the text file to write containing the grammar as a raw tree.

If '', the file is not written.

Default: ''.

Note: The bind_attributes option/method affects the output.

=item o user_bnf_file => aUserBNFFileName

Specify the name of the file containing your Marpa::R2-style grammar.

See share/stringparser.bnf for a sample.

This option is mandatory.

Default: ''.

=head1 Methods

=head2 bind_attributes([$Boolean])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the option which includes (1) or excludes (0) node attributes from the output
C<cooked_tree_file> and C<raw_tree_file>.

Note: C<bind_attributes> is a parameter to new().

=head2 compress_tree()

Called automatically by L</run()>.

Converts the raw tree into the cooked tree.

Output is the tree returned by L</cooked_tree()>.

=head2 cooked_tree()

Returns the root node, of type L<Tree::DAG_Node>, of the cooked tree of items in the user's grammar.

By cooked tree, I mean as post-processed from the raw tree so as to include just the original user's
BNF tokens.

The cooked tree is optionally written to the file name given by
L</cooked_tree_file([$output_file_name])>.

The nature of this tree is discussed in the L</FAQ>.

See also L</raw_tree()>.

=head2 cooked_tree_file([$output_file_name])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the name of the file to which the cooked tree form of the user's grammar will be written.

If no output file is supplied, nothing is written.

See share/stringparser.cooked.tree for the output of post-processing Marpa's analysis of
share/stringparser.bnf.

This latter file is the grammar used in L<MarpaX::Demo::StringParser>.

Note: C<cooked_tree_file> is a parameter to new().

Note: The bind_attributes option/method affects the output.

=head2 log($level, $s)

Calls $self -> logger -> log($level => $s) if ($self -> logger).

=head2 logger([$logger_object])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the logger object.

To disable logging, just set logger to the empty string.

Note: C<logger> is a parameter to new().

=head2 marpa_bnf_file([$bnf_file_name])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the name of the file to read Marpa's grammar from.

Note: C<marpa_bnf_file> is a parameter to new().

=head2 maxlevel([$$level])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the value used by the logger object.

This option is only used if an object of type L<Log::Handler> is created.
See L<Log::Handler::Levels>.

Note: C<maxlevel> is a parameter to new().

=head2 minlevel([$$level])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the value used by the logger object.

This option is only used if an object of type L<Log::Handler> is created.
See L<Log::Handler::Levels>.

Note: C<minlevel> is a parameter to new().

=head2 new()

The constructor. See L</Constructor and Initialization>.

=head2 raw_tree()

Returns the root node, of type L<Tree::DAG_Node>, of the raw tree of items in the user's grammar.

By raw tree, I mean as derived directly from Marpa.

The raw tree is optionally written to the file name given by L</raw_tree_file([$output_file_name])>.

The nature of this tree is discussed in the L</FAQ>.

See also L</cooked_tree()>.

=head2 raw_tree_file([$output_file_name])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the name of the file to which the raw tree form of the user's grammar will be written.

If no output file is supplied, nothing is written.

See share/stringparser.raw.tree for the output of Marpa's analysis of share/stringparser.bnf.

This latter file is the grammar used in L<MarpaX::Demo::StringParser>.

Note: C<raw_tree_file> is a parameter to new().

Note: The bind_attributes option/method affects the output.

=head2 run()

The method which does all the work.

See L</Synopsis> and scripts/bnf2tree.pl for sample code.

run() returns 0 for success and 1 for failure.

=head2 user_bnf_file([$bnf_file_name])

Here, the [] indicate an optional parameter.

Get or set the name of the file to read the user's grammar's BNF from. The whole file is
slurped in as a single string.

See share/stringparser.bnf for a sample. It is the grammar used in L<MarpaX::Demo::StringParser>.

Note: C<user_bnf_file> is a parameter to new().

=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is this BNF (SLIF-DSL) thingy?

Marpa's grammars are written in what we call a SLIF-DSL. Here, SLIF stands for Marpa's Scanless
Interface, and DSL is
L<Domain-specific Language|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language>.

Many programmers will have heard of L<BNF|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form>.
Well, Marpa's SLIF-DSL is an extended BNF. That is, it includes special tokens which only make sense
within the context of a Marpa grammar. Hence the 'Domain Specific' part of the name.

In practice, this means you express your grammar in a string, and Marpa treats that as a set of
rules as to how you want Marpa to process your input stream.

Marpa's docs for its SLIF-DSL L<are here|https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL>.

=head2 What is the difference between the cooked tree and the raw tree?

The raw tree is generated by processing the output of Marpa's parse of the user's grammar file.
It contains Marpa's view of that grammar. This raw tree is output by L<Tree::DAG_Node>.

The cooked tree is generated by post-processing the raw tree, to extract just the user's grammar's
tokens. It contains the user's view of their grammar. This cooked tree is output by this module.

And yes, the cooked tree can be used to reproduce (apart from formatting details) the user's BNF
file.

The cooked tree can be graphed with L<MarpaX::Grammar::GraphViz2>. That module has its own
L<demo page|http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/marpax.grammar.graphviz2/index.html>.

The following items explain this in more detail.

=head2 What are the details of the nodes in the cooked tree?

Under the root (whose name is 'Statements'), there are a set of nodes:

=over 4

=item o $n1 nodes, 1 per statement (BNF rule) in the grammar

Each of these $n1 nodes has the name 'statement', and each also has a sub-tree of $n2 daughter nodes
 of its own.

So, each 'statement' node is the root of a sub-tree describing that statement (rule).

These sub-trees' nodes are:

=over 4

=item o 1 node for the left-hand side of the rule

=item o 1 node for the separator between the left and right sides of the statement

So, this node's name is one of: '=' '::=' or '~'.

=item o 1 node per token from the right-hand side of the statement

These nodes' names are the tokens themselves.

=back

=back

So, for a rule like:

	array ::= ('[' ']') | ('[') elements (']') action => ::first

The nodes will be (see share/json.2.cooked.tree):

	:
    |--- statement. Attributes: {token => "statement"}
    |    |--- lhs. Attributes: {token => "array"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => "("}
    |    |    |--- rhs. Attributes: {token => "'['"}
    |    |    |--- rhs. Attributes: {token => "']'"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => ")"}
    |    |--- alternative. Attributes: {token => "|"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => "("}
    |    |    |--- rhs. Attributes: {token => "'['"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => ")"}
    |    |--- rhs. Attributes: {token => "elements"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => "("}
    |    |    |--- rhs. Attributes: {token => "']'"}
    |    |--- parenthesized_rhs_primary_list. Attributes: {token => ")"}
    |    |--- action. Attributes: {token => "action"}
    |         |--- reserved_action_name. Attributes: {token => "::first"}
	:

Firstly, strip off the first 2 daughters. They are the rule name and the separator.

Clearly, to process the remaining daughters (if any) you must start by examining them from the end,
looking for triplets of the form ($a, '=>', $b). $a will be a reserved word (an adverb). This then
is the adverb list.

What's left, if anything, is a '|' or '||' separated list of right-hand side alternatives.

See share/json.2.cooked.tree, or any file share/*.cooked.tree.

=head2 Did you know there can be multiple 'statement' nodes with the same rule (1st daughter) name?

E.g.: Parsing share/metag.bnf produces cases like this:

	:
	|--- statement
	|    |--- <start rule>
	|    |--- ::=
	|    |--- (
	|    |--- ':start'
	|    |--- <op declare bnf>
	|    |--- )
	|    |--- symbol
	|--- statement
	|    |--- <start rule>
	|    |--- ::=
	|    |--- (
	|    |--- 'start'
	|    |--- 'symbol'
	|    |--- 'is'
	|    |--- )
	|    |--- symbol
	:

See share/metag.cooked.tree.

=head2 Did you know rules do not have to have right-hand sides?

E.g.: Parsing share/metag.bnf produces cases like this:

	:
	|--- statement
	|    |--- <event initializer>
	|    |--- ::=
	|--- statement
	:

See share/metag.cooked.tree.

=head2 What happened to my use of 'forgiving'?

It is an alias for 'latm' (Longest Acceptable Token Match), so this module always outputs 'latm'.

This is deemed to be a feature.

=head2 What are the details of the nodes in the raw tree?

The first few nodes are:

	Marpa value()
	    |--- Class = MarpaX::Grammar::Parser::statements [BLESS 1]
	         |--- 0 = [] [ARRAY 2]
	              |--- 0 = 0 [SCALAR 3]
	              |--- 1 = 2460 [SCALAR 4]

This says the input text offsets are from 0 to 2460. I.e. share/stringparser.bnf is 2461 bytes long.

After this there are a set of nodes like this, one per statement:

	|--- Class = MarpaX::Grammar::Parser::statement [BLESS 5]
	|    |--- 2 = [] [ARRAY 6]
	|         |--- 0 = 0 [SCALAR 7]
	|         |--- 1 = 34 [SCALAR 8]
	|         |--- Class = MarpaX::Grammar::Parser::default_rule [BLESS 9]
	:         :

For complex statements, these node can be nested to considerable depth.

This says the first statement in the BNF is at offsets 0 .. 34, and happens to be the default rule
(':default ::= action => [values]').

See share/stringparser.raw.tree, or any file share/*.raw.tree.

=head2 Where did the basic code come from?

Jeffrey Kegler wrote it, and posted it on the Google Group dedicated to Marpa, on 2013-07-22,
in the thread 'Low-hanging fruit'. I modified it slightly for a module context.

The original code is shipped as scripts/metag.pl.

=head2 Why did you use Data::RenderAsTree?

It offered the output which was most easily parsed of the modules I tested.
The others were L<Data::TreeDump>, L<Data::Dumper>, L<Data::TreeDraw>, L<Data::TreeDumper>
and L<Data::Printer>.
